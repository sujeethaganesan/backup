<h1>Indian Islands</h1>
<p>For some people island is for water sports, beach parties and meeting new people. For some it is the dream place for lazy days, hanging hammocks and a nice book. And for the rest, it is about long walks, beautiful sunsets and equally enchanting sunrises.Whichever way, we associated them with a number of good and rejuvenating things; however, overly commercialized beaches with murky water are a big turn off. While there are many islands in India that might disappoint you, there are a few which will actually never fail to give you a relaxing and refreshing vacation. Hereâ€™s a list of some of the extremely beautiful islands of India, far away from the tourist crowd. </p>

<h2>Majuli Island</h2>
<img src='images/basic-pic1.jpg' id="taj"/>
<p>Majuli Island is the one of the biggest river islands in the world and subsequently in India. The most unique of all the islands in India, this place is famous for its breath-taking sunrises and stunning sunsets. You will get a fair taste of Assamese culture here. Out of all the islands of India, this one is the most unconventional one. You will find moss instead of sand on its coast and traditional northeastern cuisine instead of seafood. However, it will prove to be an experience worth all the travel. </p>

<h2>Diu Island</h2>
<img src='images/basic-pic2.jpg' id="char"/>
<p>This small island of India has traces of Portuguese culture infused in it. The architectural beauty and serenity can stun you to a surreal world. The exquisite beaches and tropical sea-food with a dash of Gujarati influence, will make it a notch different from other islands in India. And the best part, alcohol is legal here, unlike in Gujarat!</p>

<p>One of the untouched islands in India, Divar Island lies about 10 km upstream from Panjim, Goa. It is situated across the bustling river of Mandovi, and has retained the lively culture and countryside feel of Goa.</p>
